After running this program, you have to give the directory of the root folder*.
	*(The root folder is the folder where the html files are kept on 
	the users computer).
	For example: 'C:\Users\Anmol\Desktop\root' (This contains the index.html file)


Then in the browser, you type for example: 'localhost:7654/index.html', to get 
	the index.html file that resides in 'C:\Users\Anmol\Desktop\root'.


If the file exist, the html file will display. Otherwise not.
This program only displays html files.
